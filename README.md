IP-Project---IRC
================
This flavor of the Internet Relay Chat is coded using pyton version 2.7. The application is Unix compatible.
I have used oops to maintain the state of variables. I have used ‚Äùselect.select()" to manage multiple connections from clients.

To start the IRC Session:

1. Execute server.py
	python server.py

2. In new terminal execute client.py
	python client.py
